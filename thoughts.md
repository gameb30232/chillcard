Looking at these files, I can see they were part of an interactive card implementation that aimed to provide a user-friendly way to edit card details. Here's my analysis:

Key concepts worth preserving in `thoughts.md`:

# Interactive Card Implementation Notes

## Core Concepts
1. Click-to-edit functionality for card elements
   - Chain selector in top-left
   - Address input centered at bottom
   - Background click for other potential interactions

2. UI/UX Patterns
   - Hover states for interactive areas
   - Popover menus for editing
   - Command palette style for chain selection
   - Clear visual hierarchy with z-index layers

3. Component Architecture
   - Separation of display (CardFront) from interactive elements
   - Overlay pattern for interactive elements
   - Propagation control for nested clickable areas

## Lessons Learned
1. While the interactive approach was correct, the implementation had issues:
   - Too many floating popovers might confuse users
   - Z-index management became complex
   - Click areas might have been too subtle

2. For future implementation:
   - Consider a more modal-based approach for editing
   - Use clearer visual indicators for editable areas
   - Simplify the interaction model
   - Keep the command palette for chain selection (good UX)
```

Recommendation:
These files can be safely deleted as the core concepts are now documented. The next implementation should focus on:
1. A simpler interaction model
2. More obvious editing UI
3. Better state management
4. Clearer visual feedback

The chain selector's command palette pattern was particularly good and worth reusing in a new implementation.
